# Congressional-App-Challenge-2021
Safety App

I would like to thank one of my teachers for encouraging me in the first steps of my programming interest.
The Safety App was my first exposure to a competition-enviorment of programming.
While this app is far from my best work, it hold a special place, a milestone, in my programming learning experience.

The initial goal of this app was to altert users of danger when they were in a dangerous enviornment.
While the app is far from reaching this goal- I do believe that I became a better programmer because of this experience.


This project was created entirely in Python: it uses pandas to parse crime data, 
an matplotlib to graph the data. Additionally, the program saves the graph
and displays it in a windowing using pygame.
